# 3D Flow Visualization Requirements

## Introduction

This feature will enhance TransparAI with a real-time 3D visualization system that shows how Amazon Bedrock AgentCore processes user queries through various AWS services. The visualization will provide an immersive, educational experience showing the AI reasoning journey in three dimensions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Real-time 3D Flow Visualization

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a 3D visualization of how my AI question flows through AWS services, so that I can understand the complete reasoning journey visually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a question THEN the system SHALL display a 3D flow diagram showing the query path
2. WHEN the Bedrock Agent processes the query THEN each reasoning step SHALL appear as a 3D node in real-time
3. WHEN reasoning traces are received THEN the system SHALL animate the data flow between 3D service nodes
4. WHEN the response is generated THEN the final answer node SHALL be highlighted in the 3D space

### Requirement 2: Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to capture detailed reasoning traces from Bedrock AgentCore, so that the 3D visualization can show accurate AI thinking processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AgentCore processes a query THEN the system SHALL capture preprocessing, orchestration, and postprocessing traces
2. WHEN reasoning traces are available THEN the system SHALL extract service calls, tool usage, and decision points
3. WHEN multiple reasoning steps occur THEN each step SHALL be mapped to specific AWS services in the visualization
4. WHEN action groups are invoked THEN external API calls SHALL be visualized as separate 3D nodes

### Requirement 3: AWS Services Orchestration Visualization

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see how different AWS services work together during AI reasoning, so that I can learn about AWS AI architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes a query THEN it SHALL show API Gateway → Lambda → Bedrock Agent → Nova Pro flow
2. WHEN external services are called THEN SageMaker, S3, DynamoDB nodes SHALL appear in 3D space
3. WHEN tool integrations occur THEN Cohere API, Web Search API SHALL be visualized as external connections
4. WHEN data flows between services THEN animated 3D connections SHALL show the data path

### Requirement 4: Interactive 3D Environment

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with the 3D visualization, so that I can explore the AI reasoning process from different angles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the 3D scene THEN users SHALL be able to rotate, zoom, and pan the camera
2. WHEN clicking on a 3D node THEN detailed information SHALL be displayed in a popup
3. WHEN hovering over connections THEN the data flow direction and type SHALL be highlighted
4. WHEN reasoning is complete THEN users SHALL be able to replay the entire flow animation

### Requirement 5: Educational Insights

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to understand why the AI made specific decisions, so that I can learn about AI reasoning patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a reasoning step is selected THEN the system SHALL explain why that step was necessary
2. WHEN service connections are shown THEN tooltips SHALL explain the purpose of each integration
3. WHEN the flow is complete THEN a summary SHALL highlight key decision points and service usage
4. WHEN multiple queries are processed THEN patterns SHALL be identified and highlighted

### Requirement 6: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a user, I want the 3D visualization to be smooth and responsive, so that it doesn't interfere with the chat experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rendering 3D graphics THEN the frame rate SHALL maintain 60fps on modern browsers
2. WHEN processing complex reasoning traces THEN the visualization SHALL handle up to 20 nodes smoothly
3. WHEN multiple users access the system THEN each session SHALL maintain independent 3D scenes
4. WHEN the browser has limited resources THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to 2D visualization

## Technical Constraints

- Must use Amazon Bedrock AgentCore with reasoning traces enabled
- Must integrate with existing React frontend architecture
- Must support modern browsers with WebGL capabilities
- Must maintain existing chat functionality while adding 3D visualization
- Must handle real-time data streaming from backend services

## Success Metrics

- Users can visualize AI reasoning flow in 3D within 2 seconds of query submission
- 3D visualization accurately represents actual AWS service orchestration
- Interactive elements respond within 100ms of user input
- Educational insights help users understand AI decision-making process
