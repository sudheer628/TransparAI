# TransparAI Implementation Roadmap

## 🎯 Current Status: Phase 1 - Foundation Setup

### ✅ Completed

- [x] Project structure created
- [x] Package configurations
- [x] AWS setup documentation

### 🔄 Next Steps (Do These Now)

#### 1. AWS Bedrock Setup (15-30 minutes)

1. **Follow the guide**: Open `docs/aws-setup-guide.md`
2. **Enable Bedrock**: Request model access for Claude 3 and Nova
3. **Configure AWS CLI**: Ensure credentials are set up
4. **Verify setup**: Run `cd backend && npm install && npm run verify-aws-setup`

#### 2. Create Your First Bedrock Agent (20 minutes)

- Use AWS Console to create a Bedrock agent
- Configure with basic knowledge base
- Note down the Agent ID for configuration

#### 3. Environment Configuration (5 minutes)

- Copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env`
- Fill in your AWS credentials and agent ID

## 📋 Upcoming Phases

### Phase 2: Backend Development

- [ ] Express server setup
- [ ] Bedrock agent integration
- [ ] Reasoning trace processing
- [ ] API endpoints creation

### Phase 3: Frontend Development

- [ ] React app initialization
- [ ] Chat interface component
- [ ] React Flow visualization
- [ ] AWS service icons integration

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing

- [ ] End-to-end testing
- [ ] External API integration (Serper for Web Search)
- [ ] Performance optimization

### Phase 5: Deployment

- [ ] TBD

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
cd backend && npm install
cd ../frontend && npm install

# Verify AWS setup
cd backend && npm run verify-aws-setup

# Start development (after AWS setup)
npm run dev
```

TransparAI - Further Development Steps
📋 Project Overview
TransparAI is an educational AI assistant that visualizes how Large Language Models think and reason through problems. It's built as a ChatGPT-like interface powered by Amazon Bedrock Agents that shows step-by-step reasoning flows in real-time.

Core Concept
"A LLM MindMap — Visualizing How AI Thinks"

The project demonstrates how Large Language Models reason and orchestrate AWS AI services autonomously, visualizing each step in a flow diagram to make the "black box" transparent for ML/AI learners.

 Flow Data Generation - Creates comprehensive flow diagrams
 Trace Processing - Extracts preprocessing, orchestration, postprocessing steps
 Error Handling - Robust error handling and fallbacks
 Debugging Added - Console logs for troubleshooting
Phase 3: Frontend Visualization
 Chat Interface - Working ChatGPT-like interface with markdown support
 Flow Visualization - 2D reasoning flow using React Flow
 Dark Tech Theme - Professional blue/cyan color scheme
 Interactive Nodes - Clickable nodes with detailed information
 Responsive Design - Works on desktop and mobile
 Attribution Footer - AWS AI Agent Global Hackathon powered by DEVPOST
Phase 4: AgentCore Integration Attempts
 Enhanced Trace Capture - Attempted advanced AgentCore reasoning extraction
 3D Visualization Planning - Created specs for 3D flow visualization
 Troubleshooting - Resolved backend startup issues and flow data problems
🎯 Current Status (Working Features)
✅ What's Working:
Chat Interface - Users can ask ML/AI questions and get responses
Bedrock Agent Integration - Connected to existing agent (STQJFYK634)
Flow Visualization - Shows reasoning flow: User → Bedrock Agent → Nova Pro → Response
Reasoning Traces - Captures and displays preprocessing, orchestration, postprocessing steps
Interactive UI - Click nodes for details, animated connections
Professional Design - Dark tech theme with proper branding
🔧 Current Flow Structure:
User Question → Bedrock Agent → [Reasoning Steps] → Nova Pro Model → AI Response
📊 Data Flow:
User submits question via chat interface
Frontend sends request to backend /api/bedrock/chat
Backend invokes Bedrock Agent with enableTrace: true
Agent processes with Nova Pro model
Backend captures reasoning traces and generates flow data
Frontend visualizes flow using React Flow with custom nodes
