## 🎯 Project Overview

**TransparAI** transforms the "black box" of AI reasoning into a transparent, visual learning experience. Built for the **AWS AI Agent Global Hackathon**, this educational platform shows exactly how Large Language Models think, reason, and orchestrate AI services to solve problems.

### 💡 The Problem We Solve

- **AI Opacity**: Students and developers struggle to understand how LLMs reason through complex problems
- **Learning Gap**: Traditional AI interfaces hide the step-by-step decision-making process
- **Educational Need**: ML/AI learners need visual tools to grasp how modern AI systems work

### 🎯 Our Solution

A **ChatGPT-like interface** that reveals the AI's "thought process" through:
- ✨ **Real-time reasoning visualization** using interactive flow diagrams
- 🧠 **Step-by-step breakdown** of AI decision-making
- 🎨 **Educational UI** designed for learning and exploration
- 🔍 **Transparent AI** - see exactly how your query gets processed

## 🏆 Hackathon Achievement
